# MyReads Project

The application was created with create-react-app and the started template of MyReads project from Udacity including the Books API.

# Project Overview

MyReads project is a React app that allows user to search books and categorized the books in 3 different shelves. The user can move around the books in between shelves.

# Project Specification

I was given the starter static template and my job is to seperate the code into different components and add functionality to the code to make it interactive.

# The App Functionality

The app has a main page that shows 3 different categories/ shelves. Currently Reading, Want To Read and Read. There's a Search/ + icon/ button at the bottom's right corner that link to a Search page where user can search for books. The user can move the books to any shelves.

# How to install and run the project

To get started with the project, download or clone the repository into your local machine/ computer:

$ git clone https://github.com/ninaherlina/my-reads.git

In the Project folder:

Install all project dependencies with "npm install"

Start the Project with "npm start"

# Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
